# Heart Disease Prediction Model

I have created a  machine learning model which will predict that a person is having heart disease or not.

I have used kaggle dataset for training my model .

My model is taking some inputs like:

Age: Patient’s Age in years.
Sex: Patient’s Gender. (1 = Male, 0 = Female)
ChestPainType: Chest Pain type (4 values :0,1,2,3)
RestingBP: resting Blood Pressure. ( in mm Hg )
Cholesterol: Serum Cholesterol. ( in mg/dl )
FastingBS: Fasting Blood Sugar > 120 mg/dl. (0 = True, 1 = False)
RestingECG: resting Electroencephalographic result. (values: 0,1,2 :Normal, ST, LVH)
MaxHR: Maximum Heart Rate achieved.(thalach)
ExerciseAngina: Exercise induced Angina. ( 0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Oldpeak: ST Depression induced by Exercise relative to rest.
ST_Slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment. (values:0,1,2)
number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
HeartDisease:: Heart Disease occured. (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

from these inputs my model is predicting that a person is having heart disease or not
