# Heart Disease Prediction Model

Project Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict whether a person has heart disease based on several medical and demographic factors. The model was trained using a publicly available dataset from Kaggle and is designed to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis.



Dataset
Source: Kaggle Dataset
Features:
Age: Patient's age in years.
Sex: Patient's gender (1 = Male, 0 = Female).
ChestPainType: Chest pain type (values: 0, 1, 2, 3).
RestingBP: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg).
Cholesterol: Serum cholesterol (in mg/dl).
FastingBS: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (0 = True, 1 = False).
RestingECG: Resting electrocardiographic results (values: 0 = Normal, 1 = ST, 2 = LVH).
MaxHR: Maximum heart rate achieved.
ExerciseAngina: Exercise-induced angina (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
ST_Slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (values: 0, 1, 2).
Number of Major Vessels: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy.
Thal: Thalassemia status (0 = Normal, 1 = Fixed defect, 2 = Reversible defect).
HeartDisease: Target variable (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
